Key Points of the Challenge
    - Allows City staff to easily update, maintain, and revise as our organization shifts over time
    - Tell a story about the city
    - Be able to 'zoom' into the neighborhood so you can compare your neighborhood with the rest of the communiy
    - Take a lot of data and turn it into a 'story'
    - Map data, economic data, development data, parking ticket etc
    - How do you compare? (Think about like cost of living calcs and cool new york times stuff)

Initial data points that they want to look at
    - Housing mix-number of issued permits for single-family homes, townhouses, duplexes, and multi-family.
    - Commercialspace-total square feet of newly construction commercial space.
    - Affordable housing-number of existing and newly constructed affordable housing units.
    - Population and job growth-past and projected.
    - Multi-unit property tax exemption (MUPTE)-number of units developed with the MUPTE program and impacts to tax revenue.
    - (We get ten data sets to look at)

Risks and Issues
    - No conforming data sets
    - Lack of geographical data
    - Difficult to take something that is easily modular but still indepth**
    - Lack of knowledge about google maps API
    - Lack of design experience
    - Need to decide on software stack

- .NET based
- IIS Web Server
- Node and React is fine
- Make sure that it is easy to set up
- All the data is in a SQL server
- Real time data for visualiztations
- Needs to run queries against SQL
- Maybe have a way of displaying stuff for city vs region data

- Interesting stuff
    - By car brand
- Seattle crime dashboard
    - Too hard to navigate and understand what the data was trying to display
    - Well designed but not easily interpreted
